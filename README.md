# data-analytics-insights
to provide some insight of data and how can we build algorithm from scratch using the data.


Here I hot the data, on which I am going to perform some exploratory data analysis and building different model to predict the label.
I have also updated the report which is self explanatory.
Algorithm used are 
1) cross validation metrhods
2) Random forest with tunning parameters
3) boosting methods
4) and data used for code

All this is build using R langauage.

Thanks
